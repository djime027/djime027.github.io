    <p data-start="0" data-end="32" class="david">David: Good afternoon, thank you for agreeing to do this interview
      today. My name is David Jiménez, and this interview will discuss my childhood educational experiences and the
      impact my parents had on the trajectory of my academic career. Today, I want to understand your perspectives on
      certain events from my youth and your general attitude about education. If at any time you want me to stop
      recording, please let me know.</p>
    <p data-start="32" data-end="37" class="david">To start, can you tell me your name and how we are related?</p>
    <p data-start="37" data-end="44" class="maria">María: My name is María Jiménez, and we are related—I am your mom.
    </p>
    <p data-start="44" data-end="50" class="david">Right, and what is your current occupation?</p>
    <p data-start="50" data-end="54" class="maria">I’m a preschool teaching assistant.</p>
    <p data-start="54" data-end="61" class="david">In preschool, and you work in Special Ed, right?</p>
    <p data-start="61" data-end="62" class="maria">Correct.</p>
    <p data-start="62" data-end="74" class="david">Well, could you tell me a little bit about your background, where
      you're from, and what education was like for you as a child?</p>
    <p data-start="74" data-end="125" class="maria">I come from Mexico, specifically from the city of Guadalajara. I
      studied through high school, and then I did a short vocational program as a secretary. During my time, education
      was not as accessible, especially for women in certain families. We were only provided with an education that
      centered on home assistance, like nursing, cooking, and sewing. It was very, very limited</p>
    <p data-start="125" data-end="149" class="david">Okay, and since then, you’ve come to the United States, where my
      brother and I were born. Now, to talk about my early educational history is really to talk about our history. Is
      it true that you were very involved in the education of both me and my brother from the beginning?</p>
    <p data-start="149" data-end="151" class="maria">Correct.</p>
    <p data-start="151" data-end="161" class="david">What motivated you to do this, and did you ever encounter any
      resistance?</p>
    <p data-start="161" data-end="235" class="maria">My motivation came from seeing that many parents couldn’t
      communicate effectively with their children, even in Spanish. I focused on teaching you to speak and understand
      Spanish correctly. I then got involved; I volunteered for seven years during your [mine and my brother’s]
      transition from primary to secondary education, helping in classrooms, observing you at recess, and on school
      trips. I enjoyed volunteering, and I got involved because I saw that Latino parents could do more to educate
      their children and themselves about what was happening at school. For that reason, I also got involved in school
      to learn English.</p>
    <p data-start="235" data-end="242" class="david">At what age do you remember me starting school?</p>
    <p data-start="242" data-end="300" class="maria">You started in a pilot program for preschool children at three
      years old. I took you in the afternoons, and I saw early on your interest in school. The program lasted no more
      than three months, after which they allowed you to continue directly into regular preschool in which you got
      great grades. You did very well, which allowed you to continue into Kindergarten, even though you were younger
      than the required age. It was the knowledge and education you had already gained that let you move on to
      Kindergarten.</p>
    <p data-start="300" data-end="312" class="david">So, I finished a complete preschool program, right? Was that a
      year, or had you said four years?</p>
    <p data-start="312" data-end="314" class="maria">No, it was one year and four months.</p>
    <p data-start="314" data-end="326" class="david">Sorry, one year and four months, okay. And from there, I moved to
      Kindergarten. But what happened when I was already in Kindergarten?</p>
    <p data-start="326" data-end="425" class="maria">It was a difficult situation for me. Initially, I didn’t want to
      transfer schools because we felt very welcomed at your previous school where you had started, Victoriano. But
      when a school closer to our house opened, they moved you there for Kindergarten. Throughout your Kindergarten, I
      continued volunteering. I have no idea why, but it seemed I wasn't accepted anymore; I wasn’t welcomed by
      everyone. After two weeks, they notified me that you couldn’t continue in Kindergarten because you were too
      young, and they completely removed you from the program, leaving you without a school. It was hard to accept,
      and I was frustrated because there was nowhere to enroll you.</p>
    <p data-start="425" data-end="523" class="maria">They would only allow you to restart Kindergarten
      the following year, even though you had already spent a full semester in Kindergarten. They even told me that if
      I wanted you to now finish out the year in preschool, it would be on the condition that I be required to
      “volunteer” because now this class’s size would be one greater. Despite this, I didn’t give up. I got involved
      in the ELAC and DELAC programs to try to get in contact with someone who could help. I ended up going to a
      school board meeting, finding the superintendent and planting myself in front of home to ask for a meeting to
      present your case. After facing many obstacles, I eventually met with the superintendent, and I am grateful that
      he was so kind when I had been rejected by so many district office personnel. He contacted me personally and
      gave me the chance to explain your situation.</p>
    <p data-start="523" data-end="575" class="david">There are many details of that story that I don’t remember much
      of, since I was so young. But I remember you saying that there were other children who were also too young who
      weren't removed like I was? Do you think the fact that I was a Latino student who only spoke Spanish, and that
      you too were more visible as a volunteer, made us more likely to be targeted?</p>
    <p data-start="575" data-end="675" class="maria">Yes, I believe it was a form of discrimination. They may have
      used us as an example to others. It wasn’t fair that other children, who were also too young, were allowed to
      stay, especially since your birthday was exactly 10 days after the cutoff, and you were one of the most advanced
      in your class. That’s why I presented your case to the superintendent, along with a testimony from your teacher
      saying how well you were doing. That you, having started school not knowing a word of English, within one year
      were starting to master the language, and knew your numbers from 1-100 and your ABCs. You had good pronunciation
      and were reading well. So then the superintendent and assistant superintendent decided to give you an exam to
      see if you were at Kindergarten grade level and could stay.</p>
    <p data-start="675" data-end="773" class="maria">Waiting outside that testing room made me so nervous, but then
      they came out to tell me that you not only met expectations, but far exceeded them. It was an accomplishment,
      both yours and mine as a mother, to see that we hadn't let the system and certain people keep us from achieving
      our goals. From that date on, I continued volunteering as president of the bilingual leadership programs and
      encouraged a lot of mothers to continue supporting their childrens’ studies. It made me very sad sometimes to
      see schools use students to translate because there were staff cuts or there weren't enough staff to translate
      for the parents. So it is sad that us parents are sometimes not involved. I liked it so much that I have
      continued working for the district and continued to urge many parents to continue with studies or preparation to
      help them help their children.</p>
    <p data-start="773" data-end="823" class="david">That’s a perfect answer. I especially want to relate that to an
      article we read in class about the myth that Mexican-Americans don’t value education. I think it’s clear from
      our experiences that this isn’t true. Do you remember any specific ways in which you emphasized the importance
      of education in our home?</p>
    <p data-start="823" data-end="876" class="maria">Absolutely. I’ve always believed that better education means a
      better quality of life, not just for the person studying, but for their environment as well. Not just that we
      encouraged you, but you and your brother motivated me and other parents to continue studying. That’s why we
      should all continue studying and not devalue the education we receive as a right, even if it’s in a different
      language. We as parents should not distance ourselves from our children’s education, we should teach them to
      value and exercise their rights to it.</p>
    <p data-start="876" data-end="917" class="david">That’s a great point, that education and motivation can go both
      ways. I wanted to bring up—I remember a specific example, I don't know if you remember this—you once assigned my
      brother and I to write an essay in Spanish that you graded to see how well we knew Spanish, to see if we weren’t
      losing it from only speaking English at school. But that’s all been in our, would infants be the word?</p>
    <p data-start="917" data-end="918" class="maria">Childhood.</p>
    <p data-start="918" data-end="946" class="david">Childhood. But well, where we are now, my brother and I, we both
      have degrees in computer science and I am now in a master's program. First, I want to say that I really
      appreciate everything you have done for me. I would never have made it this far if it wasn't for you. So, could
      you say a little bit about how you feel about how far we've come?</p>
    <p data-start="946" data-end="989" class="maria">I feel very proud because I really was not given the tools to
      pursue my studies, and I have always valued that all students have the opportunity and all our children have the
      opportunity to excel more than we have. It is our pride and it is something that we enjoy as parents, seeing
      that our children go further, that they pass on what we did so that they value what they have and also have
      better life opportunities.</p>
    <p data-start="989" data-end="1009" class="david">Well, those were all the questions I had for you. Thank you so
      much for your answers and for helping me with this project. I really appreciate everything you’ve done for me.
    </p>
    <p data-start="1009" data-end="1029" class="maria">To finish, I want to say that I’m very proud of everything
      you’ve done, of the good son you are, and how you continue to motivate me to keep studying. Keep going with your
      education, and I hope you have many achievements in the future. Thank you.</p>
